### 1. Description:
This project was built using two of the most popular Machine Learning Technique named SVM and MNB. It is a classification-based supervised learning project. Natural Language Processing techniques like TF-IDF also used for feature extraction. More details about the project can be found on the report.
The Dataset is collected from Kaggle and the language of the dataset is English. 

### 2. Dataset:

Dataset is provided by Kaggle and can be found at below links:

### 3. File Descriptions:
1. `data.csv` - the whole dataset
2. `Real` - 1719
3. `Fake` - 1803   

### 4. Models:
1. `TF-IDF` - TF-IDF is a very popular feature extraction technique. Text needs to converted into vector or matrix before fed them to the Machine Learning model.  
2. `Support Vector Machines`
3. `Multinomial Naive Bayes`  

### 5. Evaluation
1. `Confusion Matrix`
2. `Accuracy` 
3. `F1 Score`
